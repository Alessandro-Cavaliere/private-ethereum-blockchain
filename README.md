# Private Ethereum Blockchain 
 
Here is an example of Private Ethereum Blockchain using Go Ethereum (Geth) and the Puppeth tool for quickly spinning up and managing private development networks.

*Running your own node allows you to use Ethereum in a truly private, self-contained, trustless way. You don't have to trust the information you receive because you can verify the data yourself using your Geth instance.*
